# Joshua Lomond's Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, [joshlomond.dev](https://joshlomond.dev).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size, from mobile to desktop.
- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to display my work.
- **Interactive Components**: Built with React and TypeScript for a modern user experience.
- **Dark Mode**: Light and dark theme options.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Deployment**: [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) via [OpenNext](https://open-next.js.org/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Cloudflare Pages. The `deploy` script in `package.json` handles the build and deployment process:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This uses the `@opennextjs/cloudflare` package to build the Next.js application and deploy it to Cloudflare.
